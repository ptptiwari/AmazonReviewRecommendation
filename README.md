# CapstoneProjectForRecommendation

1.  Dataset Overview
2.  Part A: Data Preprocessing
3.  Part B: Exploratory Data Analysis
4.  Part C: Feature Construction
5.  Part D: Model Training and Evaluation
6.  Part E: Model Deployment (It is still pending)

This Machine Learning end-to-end project consists of the following tasks:

1. Performed Text data processing and EDA on review texts to remove noise and handle imbalanced data and outliers
2. Constructed numerical features for prediction by implementing frequency-based features like TF and TF-IDF
3. Implemented, trained and evaluated various Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic regression, SVM and Random Forest. 
4. Achieved accuracy of ~82% and deploying the trained model to a public API endpoint on OCI compute instance.

Two solution for encoding and decoding the email
- Trying to calculate the loss and fitting the model. Later evaluating the model.
- Encode and decoder -> First solution is using Database of sql lit
- Encode and decoder -> Another solution is using dictionary
